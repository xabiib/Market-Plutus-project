1) Buyer picks a product from  the Market place
2) submit to buy transaction by sending the price of the product.
3) Seller accepts by depositing product NFT to contract address
4) Seller ships or sends the product to the Buyer
5) Buyer confirms and releases the amount locked into Smart Contract to the Seller. 

A mediator can step in if a dispute happens in the transaction. Mediators will either send the amount to the Seller or refund the Buyer and take fees in most outcomes.
